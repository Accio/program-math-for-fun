## Monty Hall Problem (蒙提霍尔问题)

The Monty Hall Problem ([Wikipedia in English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)) is an interesting problem of probability theory and game theory. The **sim-monty-hall** program simulates a large number (for instance N=10000) of the game as formulated by Marilyn vos Savant. As the results clearly show, the probably of winning the car is about 2/3 if one chooses to switch the choice, and 1/3 otherwise.
